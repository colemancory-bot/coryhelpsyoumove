  <p style="color:var(--text-muted);font-size:0.88rem;margin-bottom:2.5rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;border-bottom:1px solid var(--border)">Occupancy taxes, permit requirements, zoning restrictions, and what every buyer should know before purchasing a vacation rental property in the WNC mountains.</p>

  <h2>Why This <em>Matters</em></h2>
  <p>Western North Carolina is one of the strongest short-term rental (STR) markets in the Southeast. Mountain cabins in Bryson City, vacation homes in Maggie Valley, and lake houses near Cashiers generate meaningful rental income for property owners &mdash; but the regulatory landscape varies significantly from one county (and one municipality) to the next.</p>
  <p>If you are buying a property with rental income in mind, you need to understand the rules before you close. A cabin that is perfectly legal to rent in unincorporated Haywood County may face restrictions inside Waynesville town limits. A property in Highlands may not be rentable at all depending on its zoning district.</p>
  <p>This guide covers the four counties where I work &mdash; Haywood, Jackson, Swain, and Macon &mdash; and the municipalities within them. Rules change, so I have included direct links to official sources wherever possible.</p>

  <h2>State-Level Taxes: <em>What Every NC Host Pays</em></h2>
  <p>Before getting into county-specific rules, every short-term rental operator in North Carolina is subject to state-level taxes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>NC state sales tax:</strong> 4.75% on all accommodation rentals</li>
    <li><strong>Local sales tax:</strong> An additional 2&ndash;2.75% depending on the county (applied automatically)</li>
    <li><strong>Combined sales tax:</strong> 6.75&ndash;7.5% total on each booking</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These state and local sales taxes apply in addition to the county-level occupancy taxes described below. If you rent a property for fewer than 15 days per calendar year, you are exempt from state sales tax collection &mdash; but you should still verify county occupancy tax obligations.</p>
  <p>Platforms like Airbnb and VRBO collect and remit state and local sales taxes on behalf of hosts in North Carolina. However, county occupancy taxes are not always handled by the platform &mdash; hosts should confirm collection status with each county. For full details, see the <a href="https://www.ncdor.gov/taxes-forms/sales-and-use-tax/rentals-accommodations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NC Department of Revenue: Rentals of Accommodations</a>.</p>

  <h2>Haywood County <em>(Waynesville, Maggie Valley)</em></h2>
  <p>Haywood County is the largest STR market in the area covered by this guide. Maggie Valley in particular has a long history as a vacation destination, and cabin rentals are a major part of the local economy.</p>

  <h3>Occupancy Tax</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Current rate:</strong> 4% of gross rental receipts</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed increase:</strong> <a href="https://dashboard.ncleg.gov/api/Services/BillSummary/2025/H169-SMSV-43(e2)-v-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Bill 169</a> (2025&ndash;2026 session) would authorize an increase from 4% to 6%</li>
    <li><strong>Applies to:</strong> All accommodations rented for fewer than 90 consecutive days</li>
    <li><strong>Exemption:</strong> Properties rented fewer than 15 days per calendar year</li>
    <li><strong>Administered by:</strong> <a href="https://www.haywoodcountync.gov/336/Occupancy-Tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haywood County Finance Office</a>, with funds transferred to the <a href="https://haywoodtda.com/occupancy-tax-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haywood County Tourism Development Authority</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>All rental property operators must register with the Haywood County Finance Office and file occupancy tax returns monthly.</p>

  <h3>Waynesville (Town Limits)</h3>
  <p>The Town of Waynesville has been developing a dedicated STR ordinance. Key provisions under consideration include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A formal STR permit system</li>
    <li>Distinction between "homestays" (owner-occupied properties where a portion is rented) and full-property rentals</li>
    <li>Commercial general liability insurance requirements</li>
    <li>Off-street parking requirements (one space per bedroom)</li>
    <li>Occupancy limits tied to septic capacity and building codes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As of early 2026, check with the <a href="https://www.waynesvillenc.gov/departments/development-services/land-use-zoning-ordinances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waynesville Development Services</a> department for the latest status. If you are buying a property inside Waynesville town limits with rental intentions, verify the current rules before closing.</p>

  <h3>Maggie Valley</h3>
  <p>Maggie Valley operates under Haywood County's regulations. The town has historically been welcoming to vacation rentals, and STRs are a significant part of the local economy. Properties in Maggie Valley are subject to the county's 4% occupancy tax. There is no separate municipal STR permit requirement at this time.</p>
  <p>For more on the Maggie Valley market, see our <a href="../towns/maggie-valley.html">Maggie Valley real estate page</a>.</p>

  <h2>Jackson County <em>(Sylva, Cashiers, Dillsboro, Cullowhee)</em></h2>
  <p>Jackson County encompasses a wide range of STR markets &mdash; from student-area rentals near WCU in Cullowhee to luxury mountain homes in the Cashiers corridor.</p>

  <h3>Occupancy Tax</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Current rate:</strong> 4% (through June 30, 2025)</li>
    <li><strong>New rate:</strong> <strong>6%</strong> effective July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Applies to:</strong> All accommodations rented for fewer than 90 consecutive days</li>
    <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Operators must register using the <a href="https://www.jacksonnc.org/finance-department/occupancy-tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackson County Room Occupancy Tax Registration</a> form</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Sylva (Town Limits)</h3>
  <p>The Town of Sylva adopted a dedicated STR ordinance in August 2022. Key provisions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accessory use only:</strong> New short-term rentals in residential and business zoning districts are only permitted as an accessory use &mdash; meaning the primary use of the property must be owner-occupied or a long-term rental</li>
    <li><strong>No standalone STRs:</strong> You cannot purchase a property inside Sylva town limits solely to operate as a short-term rental (unless it was grandfathered)</li>
    <li><strong>Grandfathering:</strong> Properties that paid occupancy tax on STR income during a specific window in 2021&ndash;2022 were grandfathered and may continue operating</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is one of the more restrictive municipal ordinances in the region. If you are considering a property inside Sylva town limits for rental income, verify its status with the <a href="https://townofsylva.org/zoning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Town of Sylva Zoning Department</a> before making an offer.</p>

  <h3>Cashiers and Unincorporated Jackson County</h3>
  <p>Cashiers is an unincorporated community, so it falls under Jackson County's regulations rather than any municipal ordinance. STRs are generally permitted in unincorporated Jackson County, subject to the county occupancy tax. However, many properties in the Cashiers area are within private communities or subdivisions that have their own covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&amp;Rs) &mdash; and these may prohibit or limit short-term rentals regardless of county rules.</p>
  <p>Always review the HOA documents and deed restrictions before purchasing a property for rental purposes in Cashiers. See our <a href="../towns/cashiers-highlands.html">Cashiers &amp; Highlands real estate page</a> for more on the area.</p>

  <h2>Swain County <em>(Bryson City)</em></h2>
  <p>Bryson City and Swain County have a strong tourism economy driven by Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Nantahala Gorge, and the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad. Vacation rentals are an established part of the market.</p>

  <h3>Occupancy Tax</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rate:</strong> 6% of gross rental receipts</li>
    <li><strong>Applies to:</strong> All accommodations rented for fewer than 90 consecutive days</li>
    <li><strong>Exemption:</strong> Private residences or cottages rented fewer than 15 days per calendar year</li>
    <li><strong>Filing:</strong> Monthly, due by the 20th of the following month</li>
    <li><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="https://www.swaincountync.gov/download/occupancy-tax-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swain County Occupancy Tax Office</a> &mdash; (828) 488-9273</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bryson City STR Requirements</h3>
  <p>STR operators in Bryson City should be aware of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Registration with the town and with Swain County for tax collection purposes</li>
    <li>Compliance with occupancy limits and safety requirements</li>
    <li>Collection and remittance of the 6% county occupancy tax</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Bryson City's cabin rental market is well-established, and numerous property management companies operate in the area. For more on the market, see our <a href="../towns/bryson-city.html">Bryson City real estate page</a>.</p>

  <h2>Macon County <em>(Franklin, Highlands)</em></h2>
  <p>Macon County presents the starkest contrast in the region: Franklin and Highlands are in the same county but have vastly different approaches to short-term rentals.</p>

  <h3>Occupancy Tax</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rate:</strong> 3% of gross rental receipts (the lowest rate among the four counties in this guide)</li>
    <li><strong>Applies to:</strong> All accommodations rented for fewer than 90 consecutive days</li>
    <li><strong>Exemption:</strong> Nonprofit charitable, educational, or religious organizations furthering their nonprofit purpose</li>
    <li><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="https://www.franklinnc.com/room-occupancy-tax-franklin-nc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Town of Franklin Room Occupancy Tax</a> &mdash; Kim Camp at (828) 349-2418</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Franklin</h3>
  <p>Franklin and unincorporated Macon County currently treat short-term rentals as a permitted residential use. There is no separate municipal STR permit or registration requirement beyond the county occupancy tax. This makes Franklin one of the more straightforward jurisdictions for STR operators in the region.</p>
  <p>Franklin's lower price points and affordable acreage also make it attractive for buyers looking at investment property. See our <a href="../towns/franklin.html">Franklin real estate page</a> for more.</p>

  <h3>Highlands</h3>
  <p>Highlands has the most restrictive STR regulations in Western North Carolina &mdash; and the rules are still evolving through active litigation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>September 2022:</strong> New STRs were prohibited in R-1 and R-2 residential zoning districts</li>
    <li><strong>September 2024:</strong> The Town Board voted to amortize (phase out) all existing STRs in R-1 and R-2 zones</li>
    <li><strong>September 2027:</strong> Scheduled deadline for all existing STRs to cease operations in R-1 and R-2 zones</li>
    <li><strong>March 2025:</strong> A Macon County judge ruled in favor of Save Highlands (a group challenging the ordinance), denying the Town's motion to dismiss and ordering the Town to pay attorney fees</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The legal situation in Highlands is fluid. If you are considering purchasing a property in Highlands for short-term rental use, consult a local real estate attorney before proceeding. The outcome of the ongoing litigation could significantly affect property rights and rental permissions in the town.</p>

  </div>
  <p><em>Note: All counties also require collection of NC state + local sales tax (6.75&ndash;7.5% combined) on top of the occupancy tax rates shown above.</em></p>

  <h2>Insurance and <em>Liability</em></h2>
  <p>Regardless of which county your property is in, short-term rental operators in North Carolina should carry:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Commercial general liability insurance:</strong> Standard homeowner's policies typically do not cover short-term rental activity. Most insurers offer a separate vacation rental or landlord policy. Some municipalities (including Waynesville's proposed ordinance) may require a minimum coverage amount.</li>
    <li><strong>Umbrella policy:</strong> Provides additional liability coverage beyond your primary policy limits. Recommended for any property hosting guests.</li>
    <li><strong>Property coverage:</strong> Ensure your policy covers the property's full replacement cost and includes coverage for guest-caused damage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Airbnb and VRBO offer host protection programs, but these are not substitutes for your own insurance policy. Consult with a local insurance agent who understands the vacation rental market.</p>

  <h2>HOA and Deed <em>Restrictions</em></h2>
  <p>County and municipal rules are only part of the picture. Many properties in Western NC &mdash; particularly in Cashiers, Highlands, and newer subdivisions throughout the region &mdash; are subject to HOA covenants or deed restrictions that may:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prohibit short-term rentals entirely</li>
    <li>Require minimum rental periods (e.g., 30 days)</li>
    <li>Limit the number of rental days per year</li>
    <li>Require approval from an architectural review board</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These private restrictions exist independently of government regulations and can be more restrictive. Always request and review the CC&amp;Rs (covenants, conditions, and restrictions) and any HOA bylaws before purchasing a property you intend to rent.</p>

  <h2>Before You <em>Buy</em></h2>
  <p>If you are considering a property in Western North Carolina for short-term rental income, here is a practical checklist:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Confirm the zoning district.</strong> Is the property inside a municipality or in unincorporated county land? Municipal rules may be more restrictive.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for HOA or deed restrictions.</strong> Private covenants can override permissive county rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Verify permit and registration requirements.</strong> Some jurisdictions require permits; others only require occupancy tax registration.</li>
    <li><strong>Calculate your total tax burden.</strong> State sales tax (6.75&ndash;7.5%) plus county occupancy tax (3&ndash;6%) means 10&ndash;13.5% of each booking goes to taxes.</li>
    <li><strong>Get the right insurance.</strong> Switch from a standard homeowner's policy to a vacation rental policy before your first guest.</li>
    <li><strong>Talk to a local agent.</strong> STR regulations are changing across the region. An agent who works in these counties can flag potential issues before you make an offer.</li>
  </ol>
